# Test-Resources is a Micronaut feature that allows you to start
# containers for testing.
# The containers are started before the
# tests are run, and stopped after the tests are finished.
# The containers are started on-demand depending on the injected
# properties.
# In this case, the containers are started if micronaut
# injects the properties under hostnames anywhere in the application.
